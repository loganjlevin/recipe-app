# Recipe App

This project is for the second Achievement of Career Foundry's Python for Web Developers course titled Web Development & Django. In this project, I will take the Recipe app from the first Achievement and use the Django web framework to develop a fully fledged web application with multiple users and an admin panel. I will then delpy the application using Heroku, with a PostgreSQL database at the backend, HTML and CSS-based rendered pages at the frontend and Pythong-based Django as the web application framework. The final product will be dynamic and multi-user, letting users sign up and create their own content. It'll also have statistical dashboards, implementing my new data analytics and data visualization skills.
